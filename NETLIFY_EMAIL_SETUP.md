# Netlify Email Setup for Pizza, Pins & Pop

## ‚úÖ Email System Using Netlify

The Pizza, Pins & Pop event now uses Netlify's built-in form handling and notification system. No external email configuration needed!

## üìß How It Works

1. When a customer completes payment, the system:
   - Processes payment via Stripe
   - Saves registration to database
   - Sends data to Netlify function
   - Netlify handles email delivery

2. **No email credentials needed** in `.env` file
3. **Netlify manages email delivery** automatically

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

Push your code to GitHub and Netlify will automatically deploy.
