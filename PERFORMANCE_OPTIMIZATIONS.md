# Performance Optimizations Applied

## Bundle Size Reduction
- **Before**: 806KB single bundle
- **After**: 176KB main bundle + optimized chunks
- Implemented code splitting with vendor chunks:
  - vendor-react: 43KB (React core)
  - vendor-ui: 124KB (UI libraries)
  - vendor-data: 154KB (data/API libraries)
  - vendor-payments: 11KB (Stripe)

## Code Splitting & Lazy Loading
- Lazy loaded all route components (TeamSite, Admin, Store, Opponents)
- Lazy loaded below-the-fold sections (About, Team, Schedule, etc.)
- Added loading spinner for better UX during chunk loading
- Lazy loaded Stripe.js only when needed

## Image Optimization
- Created OptimizedImage component with lazy loading
- Added WebP support with fallbacks
- Added responsive srcset generation
- Added explicit dimensions to prevent layout shifts
- Preloaded hero background image
- Added loading="eager" to critical images

## Font Optimization
- Moved font loading from CSS to HTML
- Added preconnect to Google Fonts
- Preloaded critical fonts (Bebas Neue, Oswald)
- Async loaded non-critical fonts (Inter)

## Build Optimizations
- Enabled Terser minification
- Removed console.log in production
- Configured Tailwind CSS purging
- Optimized chunk size limits

## Advanced Performance Features
- **Service Worker**: Implemented for offline support and caching
- **Resource Hints**: Added preconnect/dns-prefetch for external domains
- **Critical CSS**: Inlined critical styles for faster first paint
- **Compression**: Configured gzip/brotli via Netlify
- **HTTP/2 Push**: Added server push headers for critical assets
- **Security Headers**: Added X-Frame-Options, CSP, etc.
- **Cache Headers**: Optimized cache-control for static assets

## Expected GTmetrix Improvements
- Performance Score: D (48%) → A (90%+)
- Largest Contentful Paint: 2.0s → <1.2s
- Total Blocking Time: 456ms → <100ms
- Cumulative Layout Shift: 0.43 → <0.05
- First Contentful Paint: 621ms → <400ms
- Time to Interactive: 2.2s → <1.5s

## Achieved Optimizations
✅ Service worker for caching and offline support
✅ WebP image format with fallbacks
✅ Resource hints (preconnect, dns-prefetch)
✅ Critical CSS inlining
✅ Compression configuration for Netlify
✅ Optimized third-party script loading
✅ PurgeCSS for unused styles
✅ HTTP/2 server push headers
